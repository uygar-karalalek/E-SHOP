# E-SHOP
E-Commerce Virtual shop project

The goal is to realize a Web Application
that works as a virtual shop. This application will be evaluated by my professor of E-Commerce for the homonym module at CPT Locarno school.

4) run "./linux-mac-deploy" if you want to run the application for the first time
4a) run "./linux-mac-run" if you have already deployed your app

Open the site on: http://localhost:8081/
